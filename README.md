# Angular 9+ Hocs

> Higher-oder Angular 9+ components monorepo.

## Purpose

To create a hub of libraries that contain higher-oder components that can be used by the Angular community.

Here higher-oder components take the shape of [Typescript Class decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html#class-decorators).


## Prerequisite

In order to be able to use the libraries, your project must be running at least Angular version 9.

The reason for it is that the higher-oder components are using Ivy's API and this will not work in previous versions of Angular.

## ngx-hocs-unsubscriber

Higher-oder component to automatically unsubscribe from observables in Angular component classes.
